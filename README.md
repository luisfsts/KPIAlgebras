# KPIAlgebras

#### Description:
>A framework that supports the prediction of future performance based on anticipated activity-level performance changes and control-flow changes. We have applied our approach to several real event logs, confirming our approachâ€™s practical applicability

#### Dependencies: 
* Python environment:
  * pm4py
  * flask
  * flask_cors

* Node:
  * Download and install node.js
* Angular:
  * Run the commands:
    * npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
	* npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

* GraphViz:
  * Please check the instructions at https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/install-page#item-1-2 under the Install GraphViz section.

#### Running the tool:
* Run the app.py as a python file.
* Open a command prompt at the views directory and use the command 'ng serve'.
* Open the URL http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

#### Using the tool:
Begin using the tool by selecting an Event log(.xes or .csv) and a Process model(.ptml) and click on upload:

The tool will then measure KPI values based on event data and, the process model will be displayed.

Select any node of the Process tree to check KPI values related to it.

To change the KPI values of a leaf, select the desired node, the KPI, and the amount of change (e.g., 0.,1 = 10%) and click on compute. Such changes can be discarded by clicking on the "Undo change" or "Undo all changes" buttons.

After a change, it is possible to compare the new values and original values.

To upload new pairs of Event log and Process tree, click on the import.
